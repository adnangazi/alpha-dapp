truffle compile
npm install
```
You will first need to have these followings in your computer:
- MetaMask extension for a supported browser, configured with your account, network and wallet
- Truffle Suite
- Node.js

## Run Tests
Open the project with a terminal and run this command:
```bash
truffle test
```
You will first need to have these followings in your computer:
- Ganache

Note: running tests is not compulsory

## Run Locally
Open the project with a terminal and run this command:
```bash
truffle migrate
npm start
```
You will first need to have these followings in your computer:
- Ganache

Note: running locally is not compulsory

## Deployment
Run as in local without migrating, and only use this command after noticing the system is not working:
```bash
truffle migrate --network <your_network>
```
Note: you can also reach the system by clicking [here](https://alpha-notary.vercel.app/src/index.html), but due to a port configuration problem, it only visualizes the GUI. You can also open directly di batch file "app" or its shortcut "AlphaNotary", instead. You can move the shortcut where you want.

## FAQ
#### What is Lite mode?
Lite mode switches to a lighter Smart Contract, which avoids monitoring your transactions: all the prime functionalities are maintained, just you can't see your actions log for more operational speed and less transactions costs.

#### What is Full mode?
Full mode is the default one and it switches to a heavier Smart Contract, which monitors your transactions so you can see your actions log for tracking and controlling the correctness of your authentication process work flow.

#### How do I now my documents are not exposed?
Your documents are safe because AlphaNotary doesn't save or conserve them. On your device and only there your documents are taken, immediately calculated the hash code and right then removed. The only exposed contents are the hash codes, but they are encrypted several times during the notarization and monitoring processes, and, to make matters worse, hash codes don't permit to recreate the original document from them.

#### How do I start Using AlphaNotary?
All you need to start notaring is having the MetaMask extension on your browser: install it from the extension marketplace of the browser, and then create your account there. You will also need to configure the network you want to use, and finally charge you wallet with come coins. Also check to have a browser that supports These technologies.

#### How do I check my Blockchain interactions?
Any time you interact with the Blockchain, MetaMask creates a new transaction that you have to confirm. From that page you can get the link you need to go to the Blockchain scanning website of your current network. In the scanning page you will see all the details in real time of your transactions.

#### How can I contribute to AlphaNotary?
Very glad to see you here, it means you really liked our product. AlphaNotary is completely free and open source, so just go to the repository, study its documentation and pull a request to contribute, we will be very to collaborate! You can also refer us if you prefer.

#### Just giving it a look...
It is pretty understandable if you don't want to start using AlphaNotary. We always suggest to give a chance to our product, but if you just want to see how it works, you can do the same: follow the instruction to get started but configure in MetaMask a test network or a local network instead of using the main networks. In this way no real money will be envoled: for test networks you have ask for faucets (small amount of fake coins usable only in the test networks) at the appropriate website; for the local network we suggest to install Ganache, and automatically all will be setted up.
#### What to do in case of errors?

Not having a server makes AlphaNotary resilient to common errors, so the system should always work. But if you receive an error, just try to refresh the website, and MetaMask furthermore. Also try to check the many error log that the system prints to see what's going wrong. Try to control your network state and the operation that your were trying to do are even further steps. Last, feel free to contact us if none of this solutions works: we will be happy to help you!
